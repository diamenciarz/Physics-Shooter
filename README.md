This was a Unity project, where I tested the multiplayer capabilities of Unity using Photon.
In it, I establish a connection between a host and guest computer, add players into a waiting lobby, start a game, and synchronize the game between computers.
Two players can be in the game and correctly see their position and rotation in the game.
If one player shoots a bullet, it will correctly display on the other game client.

I would love to continue working on this project when I have more time in the future.
